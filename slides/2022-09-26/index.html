# Visualization

&gt; &#34;This practice must be __imaginary__, rather than perceptual [ ... ] the ability to assemble a visualization manifests from the __authority of the visualizer__ [ ... ] Visuality supplemented the violence of authority and its __separations__ [ ... ] this process is not composed simply of visual perceptions in the physical sense, but is formed by _a set of relations combining information, imagination, and insight into a rendition of physical and psychic space_.&#34;

# Visualization / Visuality

A claim on the authority to look/see and determine the visible and, consequently, what is real.

* imaginary and not necessarily perceptual
* authority over a field too complex and extensive for one person to physically apprehend
* mental / internalized, as well as material
* A complex of &#34;techniques&#34; that work together
    * Maps, diagrams, architectures, spatial divisions, technologies, media, images.
* Writing a version of history or &#34;the real&#34;

![Redaction](redaction.png)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;caption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Redaction is a technique of visuality where an authority decides what can be seen in public documents.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;

 For Mirzoeff, modern visuality has its roots in (is constituted in and by) _colonialism_.
 
 These practices shift historically but survive into present in different forms and keep their political valence.

 Authority is maintained through:

 * Classification
 * Separation
 * Normalization / Naturalization

# Three Major Historical &#34;Complexes&#34; of Visuality

* Plantation Complex

* Imperial Complex

* Military-Industrial Complex

???
Plantation -- classification:  human and slave (slave as species other than/less than human, as property); separation of free vs enslaved spaces; naturalization (quote on page # 11: Plantation owner John Hammond: &#34;You will say that man cannot hold property in man. The answer is that he can and actually does around the world over, in a variety of forms, and has always done so.&#34;  (e.g. it&#39;s the natural order of things)
-- the countervisuality of antislavery

Imperial:  classification:  cultured vs savage; separation; naturalization . . . 

Military-Industrial -- classification is  never ending and requires vigilance:  insurgent vs counter insurgent . . . everywhere, including at home

&gt; **Countervisuality**, then, is not just a different way of seeing or a different way of looking at
images but _the tactics to dismantle the visual strategies of the hegemonic system._ It is, in other words, &#34;the attempt to reconfigure visuality as a whole&#34; (p. 24) and thus &#34;the right to look,&#34; which goes even further than just the right to look back, although looking back is the first step towards countervisuality.

# Countervisuality &amp;rarr; a Claim for the &#34;Right to Look&#34;

&gt; It begins at a personal level with the look into someone else’s eyes to express friendship, solidarity, or love. That look must be mutual, each person inventing the other, or it fails. (Mirzoeff, 1)

* Autonomy from authority, &#34;from below&#34;
* Egalitarian, symmetrical
* A &#34;right to the real,&#34; to determine for oneself what _is_, alongside others, in common with others
* Not just in the future, but in the present alongside practices of countervisuality throughout history: anticolonial, abolitionist, and antifascist politics &amp;amp; movements (23)
* Not merely &#34;opposed&#34; to practices of visualization but instead &#34;the attempt to reconfigure visuality as a whole,&#34; a &#34;claim for the right to look,&#34; and &#34;a dispute over what is visible.&#34; (24)

# Discussion: tactics of countervisuality today? 

Mirzoeff discusses several historic forms of countervisuality, from representations of abolitionist heroes, to the 19th century realist paintings of peasant and working-class life, to photographic documentation of the conditions of poverty.

In his words, &#34;countervisuality proper is a claim for the right to look,&#34; which is also always a claim over the right to determine and make visible what is real, as well as a claim about history and what versions of history are valid. The right to look is a resistance to an authority that says _&#34;this is what happened,&#34;_ _&#34;this is all there is,&#34;_ or _&#34;there is nothing to see here.&#34;_ 

What forms of countervisuality or claims for the right to look do you see at work in the world today, or in the recent past?
