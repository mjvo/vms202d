![French Book Cover of Bourdieu&#39;s Distinction](bourdieu.jpg)

Pierre Bourdieu  
_Distinction:  A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste_ (1979 / 1984).

Explores relationships between:
* economic class and taste&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* economic class and social capital

---

According to Bourdieu, judgements of taste express a class-based &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;**habitus**&lt;/span&gt;, and are one of the defining elements of social identity.

&gt; &lt;q&gt;Nothing more clearly affirms one&#39;s &#39;class&#39;, nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music...there is no more &#39;classificatory&#39; practice than concert-going, or playing a &#39;noble&#39; instrument.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&amp;mdash; Bourdieu (1979) Distinction, p. 18&lt;/cite&gt;

&#34;Taste in music, décor, art, fashion, and so forth are aspects of one’s cultural capital, which is a position assumed not through wealth or class status, *per se*, but through enculturation (for example, an individual who is lower class can embody a habitus that reflects &#39;upper-class&#39; taste through education, job experience, or studying on their own).&#34; (Sturken &amp; Cartwright)

# Beeple: The First 5000 Days (NFT sold in 2021 for $69.3 million)

???
digital artist Mike &#34;Beeple&#34; Winkelmann who became a household name after selling a collage of 5000 pictures made one per day over more than thirteen years titled ‘Everydays: The First 5000 Days’ at Christie’s first-ever digital art auction in March of 2021. The NFT was sold to Singapore-based crypto investor Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, who is also the founder of the Metapurse NFT project.

As described by Christie&#39;s &#34;the individual pieces are organized in loose chronological order: zooming in reveals pictures by turn abstract, fantastical, grotesque or absurd, deeply personal or representative of current events. Recurring themes include society’s obsession with and fear of technology; the desire for and resentment of wealth; and America’s recent political turbulence.&#34; Besides being the second most expensive NFT sold to date, Everydays is also the fourth most expensive work from a living artist ever sold at auction.

* Connotations that function _ideologically;_ that is, meanings that are specific certain groups are made to seem &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;natural, univeral, and given for a whole society&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

# Ideology:

* As the _naturalization of the contingent._ (Barthes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--

* As _propaganda_.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--

* As _false consciousness_. (Marx)

class: title

## Louis Althusser (1970)&lt;br /&gt;“Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”

---

## Ideology (Althusser):

--
* is &#34;the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence&#34;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

--
* &#34;has a material existence&#34; (e.g. ideology exists in/as an _apparatus_:  an institution, a power structure, and its practices.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--
* &#34;hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects.&#34; 

---

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt; &#34;I shall then suggest that ideology &#39;acts&#39; or &#39;functions&#39; in such a way that it &#39;recruits&#39; subjects among the individuals (it recruits them all), or &#39;transforms&#39; the individuals into subjects (it transforms them all) by that very precise operation which I have called interpellation or hailing, and which can be imagined along the lines of the most commonplace everyday police (or other) hailing: &#39;Hey, you there!&#34;

## Interpellation:

* &#34;Hey you there&#34;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Ideology interpellates the individual as a subject&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Ideology  subjects,  its  function  is  to  subject,  to  unfold the  process  of  subjectivation.

## Stuart Hall

For Stuart Hall, the process of communication involves the articulation of linked but distinctive moments:

* production&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* circulation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* distribution/consumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* reproduction&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

# Reproduction?

&gt;“Once accomplished, the discourse must then be translated– transformed, again – into social practices if the circuit is to be both completed and effective. If no “meaning” is taken, there can be no “consumption”. If the meaning is not articulated in practice, it has no effect.” (Stuart Hall)

# Different &#34;Decoding Positions&#34;

1. **Dominant / Hegemonic**:&lt;br&gt;The &#34;Preferred Reading&#34; or interpretation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--

2. **Negotiated**:&lt;br&gt;A Negotiated Reading - Accepting some of preferred reading, rejecting or ignoring other parts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--

3. **Oppositional / Counter-Hegemonic**:&lt;br&gt;A “Globally Contrary” or Oppositional Reading.

---

## Hegemony

Stuart Hall adopts this term from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci

* Dominant ideologies offered and experienced as _&#34;common sense&#34;_

* Dominant ideologies are locked in struggle with other &#34;counter-hegemonic&#34; forces so their dominance is never guaranteed.
